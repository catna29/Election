                        CNN — 
                        North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, a top contender to be Donald Trump’s running mate, sought to raise expectations of President Joe Biden’s debate abilities 
                        “When he needs to, he can step up,” the Republican governor told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on “State of the Union” Sunday, pushing back on what he called “a real effort on the Biden team to try to lower expectations.”
                        Citing Biden’s long political experience, Burgum said: “This guy has got the ability – and we’ve seen it, we’ve seen him in debate four years ago.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <img class="debate_picture2" src="img/male-business-executive-giving-speech_300x250.jpg" alt="debate2"> 
                        We’ve seen him in the State of the Union this year that when he needs to, he can step up.”
                        Burgum joins Trump and other Republican allies who have sought to forecast a formidable debate showing from the presidentahead of the June 27 debate. Despite questioning 
                        Biden’s mental fitness on the campaign trail, Trump said last week that he thought Biden would be a “worthy debater,” pointing to his 2012 vice presidential debate with Paul Ryan.“I watched him with Paul Ryan, and he destroyed Paul Ryan,” Trump said. “I’m not underestimating him.”
                        This week’s one-on-one showdown will be the first presidential debate between an incumbent and a former president. It will also be the first debate since 2020 featuring either Biden, who did not face a serious challenge for the Democratic nomination, or Trump, who skipped those held during the Republican primary race.
                        A Biden campaign memo on Sunday said that the president will seek to focus on abortion, democracy, and Trump’s economic plans during the debate. The president and his team are spending the weekend before the debate at Camp David, poring over briefing binders and holding mock debate sessions.
