                            President Joe Biden launched his reelection campaign in April 2023, describing the contest between him and former President Donald Trump as a stark choice for voters between the 
                            continuation of democracy in America and its possible destruction. He is the oldest president to ever hold office and would be 86 at the end of a second term. He is married to Jill 
                            Biden and has two living children, Hunter and Ashley. His first wife and a daughter died in a car crash in 1972 and his son Beau Biden died of brain cancer in 2015.

                            Biden earned his bachelor’s degree from the University of Delaware and a law degree from Syracuse University. He had a brief career in law and local public office before being elected 
                            to the US Senate in 1972, a position he held until being sworn in as vice president under President Barack Obama in 2009.

                            Biden has pitched his second term as a continuation of his first - “let’s finish this job” was a common refrain in his reelection announcement and in subsequent speeches - and is vowing 
                            to defend rights such as abortion protections that some Republicans have threatened to erode. If reelected, Biden has said he would also protect America’s image on the world stage, preserve democracy at home and deliver on climate benchmarks.

                            Former President Donald Trump launched his bid to reclaim the White House in November 2022, aiming to become only the second commander in chief to win two nonconsecutive terms. 
                            Trump continues to deny the outcome of the 2020 election that he lost to Joe Biden and promotes baseless conspiracy theories about election fraud. He was twice impeached by 
                            the US House of Representatives, including for his role in inciting the deadly January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol following his electoral defeat. In May 2024, 
                            Trump was found guilty of all charges at his New York hush money criminal trial. He also faces charges in three other cases, including over his efforts to overturn the 
                            2020 election and his alleged mishandling of classified documents after leaving office.

                        <p> 
                            Trump graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a bachelor’s degree in economics. Before launching his successful 2016 presidential bid, Trump was a real estate 
                            developer, businessman and a reality television star as host of “The Apprentice.” He has five children and is married to Melania Trump.

                        <p> If he wins another term, Trump has said he would overhaul key factions of the federal government and slash social safety net programs. He has also vowed retribution against his 
                            political opponents and has said he would appoint a special prosecutor to “go after” Biden and his family.
